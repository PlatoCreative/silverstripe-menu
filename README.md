# Silverstripe menus

Adds multiple menus that are defined via yml and managed via the cms.

## Installation
Composer is the recommended way of installing SilverStripe modules.
```
composer require plato-creative/silverstripe-menu
```

## Requirements

- silverstripe/framework ^4.0
- symbiote/silverstripe-gridfieldextensions ^3.1
- [gorriecoe/silverstripe link](https://github.com/gorriecoe/silverstripe-link) ^1.1

## Maintainers

- [Gorrie Coe](https://github.com/gorriecoe)

## Creating custom menus

As it is common to reference MenuSets by slug in templates, you can configure sets to be created automatically during the /dev/build task. These sets cannot be deleted through the CMS.

```
gorriecoe\Menu\Models\MenuSet:
  sets:
    main: Main menu
    secondary: Another menu
```

## Nested and flat menus

By default menus will be flat, which means links can not have child links associated with them.  If you need a nested menu structure, you can do so by adding `allow_children: true` to the yml file as shown below.

```
gorriecoe\Menu\Models\MenuSet:
  sets:
    footer:
      title: Footer menu
      allow_children: true
```

## Adding links to menus

Once you have created your menus you can add links in the admin area.  The fields are inherited from [silverstripe link](https://github.com/gorriecoe/silverstripe-link).

## Automatically add links from sitetree to specific menus

If you need to automatically add links to a menu after the creation of a page, you can do so by adding the following extension to page and defining `owns_menu`.

```
Page:
  extensions:
    - gorriecoe\Menu\Extensions\SiteTreeAutoCreateExtension
  owns_menu:
    - main
    - footer
```

## Usage in template

```
<ul>
    <% loop MenuSet('footer') %>
        <li>
            {$Me}
        </li>
    <% end_loop %>
</ul>
```
